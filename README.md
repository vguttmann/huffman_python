# huffman_python
A python implementation of the Huffman-algorithm. No idea if this is actually any good, but this is only a proof of concept.

## Usage
The usage is pretty straightforward: To encode a file, name this file ˋinfiletext.txtˋ, put it in the same directory as ˋHuffman.pyˋ, and run ˋHuffman.pyˋ.

To decode a file, put the file ˋoutfilebinary.txtˋ and the file ˋbinarytreefile.txtˋ into the same directory as ˋDecoder.pyˋ, and run it. Your decoded text will be stored in ˋoutfiletext.txtˋ.

## Dependencies
This project has no dependencies apart from ˋjsonˋ, which is included in the Python standard library.
