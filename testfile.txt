Fuck! Okay Thao, calm down now. Calm down. What do I need to do now? I haven't ever stolen a car. Is that a good thing? Probably yes. Should I be stealing this car? Certainly not. Do I have a choice? Yes. But also no. Sure, I could just not do it. But then Fong and his friends will continue to harass me. But if I steal the car, will they stop? Or will I always be the little cousin? The one to do th dirty work? I'm not sure they'll stop. but what other choice do I have? They might beat me up if I just go. But also, I feel sorry for the old man. This is a really nice car, and probably one of the few things he really values. I mean, what else does he do? All he does is sit around on his front porch and drink beer since his wife passed away. What was that? Oh fuck, I think I woke up the old man. How do I get out of here? What will Fong and his friends think of me? Will they help me to get away?
